# Technical Interview Notes

## Approach

- A cultural interview as well as a technical interview
- Three types of technical interviews
  - White board
    - Typically pose a prompt and it's your job to walk through your solution
  - Take-home challenge
    - May be given a limited time to complete
  - Pair programming
    - May sit and look at code and be asked how it can be refactored
- Introduce yourself
  - Name
  - Background
  - Web development experience?
  - What is your passion? Especially as it pertains to career
  - What can you bring to the company?
- Ask questions
  - Often sitting with someone on the development team
  - Are developers in contact with customers, or is it nose to the grindstone and it's someone else's job to do that?
  - Do we get paid time to learn things?
  - The company should also make itself attractive to the potential employee
  - What's the stack like?
- The actual problem
  - How do you answer questions?
  - How do you problem solve?
  - They want to get an idea of where your knowledge begins and ends

## Process

- Vocalize - always explain what you're thinking
- Establish understanding of what they're asking for
  - How are we capturing input?
    - Should input be a specific data type?
    - Should I convert data types if they're wrong?
    - Should I error handle and consider edge cases?
  - What/where should the output look like?
- Establish approach
  - Talk through your thought process, even if it seems incoherent
    - Talk as if you're speaking to rubber ducky
  - If you don't know the answer, don't end with "I don't know"
    - End with a comma
    - Talk about how you would find the answer, and what you might do even though you don't know the exact method
  - Pseudo-code?
    - Go through steps it would take to solve problem
- Writing the actual code/solution
  - Repetition and practice is key
  - Just write syntax as best you remember
  - If there are methods / language features you don't quite remember, put your best guess and explain you know how to check the docs
- Test the code
  - Walk through how the function SHOULD RUN
  - Use an example value for input and output
