## Francis Lecture Nov 8

- Francis goes through the steps of his programming process very clearly. He maintains a good pace and uses technical terms accurately.
- Francis points out important details that are important to coding, especially with respect to syntax and good style and logical practices.
- There is a significant delay in the instructor's screen when changing between windows. So they should account for it, or a solution should be found.
- The portion on sending a POST request to the API could have been outlined more clearly, instead of moving quickly into the steps to accomplish the task.
- By the end of the lesson, the code had become so big that it was difficult to follow. It might have helped to separate the functions into different files. Again, because of the screen delay in Zoom, the instructor's voice is faster than what's being displayed on the screen. The pace of this section was also a little too fast for the complexity of the subject matter.
